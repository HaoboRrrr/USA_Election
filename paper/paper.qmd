# Introduction


# Data {#sec-data}

## Overview
Josh Pasek have discussed how to the use of Aggregation and Predictive Modeling on polling can increase prediction effectiveness[@Pasek_2015]. In this article, we will make use of predictive modeling to create a model that aim to predict the support rate of Kamala Harris in the 2024 United States presidential election using a linear regression model trained form past polling results and Dow Jones Industrial Average. 


## Measurement


## Outcome variables



## Predictor variables



# Model

We will use a linear model to predict the general polling result of Harris.


## Model set-up
For each poll, we assumed they are being sampled similarly. \
Let the support rate for Harris at day $t$ be denoted by $R_t$. And we denote the Dow Jones Industrial Average at day $t$ by $D_t$.
Then we will use linear regression model: 
$$
R_t = D_{t-60} +  D_{t-90} + \epsilon_t
$$
Where $\epsilon_t$ is an independent, normally distributed error term. 


## Model justification

We expect a positive relationship between the support rate of Harris and Dow Jones Industrial Average 60 and 90 days before. Since people tend to support the party in power when the economy is better, where the condiction of the economy is reflected by $D_t$. 

TODO: find paper to support this.

## Objective
The survey aims to capture voter intention and mood across important demographic and geographic divisions in order to predict the result of the US presidential election. This survey's methodology employs stratify sampling, effective respondent recruitment strategy and data validation techniques to ensure the accuracy of prediction.

## Sampling Approach
This survey employs Stratified Random Sampling, which involves divide the target population(In this case, the people who are eligible to vote in US) into subgroups(strata) based on their demographics characteristic. To simulate the national electorate, stratify the sample according to age, gender, race/ethnicity, education level, urban/rural domicile, and region. Also refer to the US Census data to determine the proportion of each strata, for example: if the census data shows there are 20% US citizen are between the age of 20 to 30, then there should be 20% of respondent in this age range. We aim for a starting sample of five thousand people since there were budget constraint.

## Respondent Recruitment
Partner with an online panel provider to find respondents that match each stratumâ€™s specifications.Specify quotas to ensure that, for instance, you wish to have 18% of respondents from the Midwest or 25% aging between 30 - 40. Then randomly select respondent within each strata. To promote greater response rates and retention, provide a small monetary reward, such as $5 for each completed survey. To improve inclusivity and take into consideration differences in internet availability, use both phone and online surveys. 

## Data Validation
* De-duplication: To keep distinct replies between waves, make sure respondents don't participate more than once each wave.

* Quality checks: highlight straight-lining, inconsistent replies, and other low-effort answers.

## Budget Expenditure
* \$50k - \$60k for panel provider
* \$25k for incentives
* \$10k for Telephone survey services
* \$5k for data analysis

## Survey Structure
This survey will focus only on collecting participants' preferences for presidential candidates, not senate elections.Therefore, this survey only asks participants' choice of their favored presidential candidates. This design can make the entire questionnaire more simplify, while also collecting key data for predicting the presidential election.

Screener Section: Screening out people who are eligible to vote in each state. This can filter out participants who are not eligible to vote, thereby improving the accuracy of the prediction results.
